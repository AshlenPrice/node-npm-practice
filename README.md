# Using NPM with Node

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/node-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/node-api)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Find an NPM package that solves a common problem.
-   Write a script that uses an NPM package.

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Node and NPM

-   Node modules
-   Modules available through NPM

## Demo: Install a Package for Enumeration

-   Ruby was really convenient for list processing
-   How can we do something similar in Node?

## Lab: Research Popular NPM Packages

Find the most popular packages on NPM and note, in your own words, three of the
packages. Questions to consider while you research:

1.  What problem does this package solve?
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
1.  How well maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?

## Lab: Use Packages in `randomizer.js`

Take your randomizer script from
[ga-wdi-boston/node-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/node-api). Change it
to use packages from NPM. You will need to identify what code you want to
replace with a package and then find an appropriate package using Google or the
NPM registry.

Here are a few things you might try:

-   Use `lodash` to iterate through collections.
-   Find a randomizer package to randomly sort an array.
-   Find a package to colorize terminal output and make your output pretty.
-   Decorate your output with emojis!
